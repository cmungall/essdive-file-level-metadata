  File_Name:
    title: Name of the file
    description: >-
      Provide the name of the associated file.
      File names should be unique and be as descriptive as possible about the file contents. Use only letters (e.g. CamelCase), numbers, and underscores.
      Do not include spaces. Hyphens allowed but not preferred. Use "*" wildcard when the FLMD applies to multiple files.
      For example - the same FLMD applies to all soil core files in this data package - "soil_cores_*.csv"

  File_Version:
    title: The version of the file
    description: >-
      This is the version of the data file being described in the FLMD. The data file version is assigned by the data provider and not by the system. This would change if the data file is updated after the data package is published. Changes should be explained in the Notes field.
    exact_mappings:

    examples:
    - value: '1'
    range: string
    
  Contact:
    title: Contact for the file

  Northwest_Latitude_Coordinate:
    title: Northwest Latitude Coordinate for non-point location
    description: >-
      This is part of a coordinate pair to form the Northwest corner of a bounding box for non-point locations. All geographic coordinates must be provided in WGS84 decimal format. It is strongly recommended to record the geographic coordinates in the FLMD in cases where the data file does not include geographic coordinates and the entire file consists of measurements collected at a single location. The FLMD Extractor can extract the geographic coordinates or bounding box coordinates from a CSV file following the CSV Reporting Format.
    examples:
    - value: '35.608619'
    range: decimal_degree
    minimum_value: -90
    maximum_value: 90

It is strongly recommended to record the geographic coordinates in the FLMD in cases where the data file does not include geographic coordinates and the entire file consists of measurements collected at a single location.

  Missing_Value_Codes:
    title: Report missing value codes
    description: >-
      Report all Missing Value Codes. For columns containing numeric data, use "-9999" as the missing value code (or modify to match significant figures given the data). For columns containing character data, use "N/A" as the missing value code. If entering more than one missing value code, use a vertical bar "|" or semicolon ";" instead of a comma or protect the comma with matching double quotation marks around the entire value. For more information about commas not meant to be a delimiter (e.g. used within a cell), refer to the Delimiter section of the CSV Reporting Format Detailed Guide.
    examples:
    - value: -9999; N/A
