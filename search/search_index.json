Include information about the type of data (images, observations, experimental, etc.) File_Name - Provide the name of the associated file. File names should be unique and be as descriptive as possible about the file contents. Use only letters (e.g. CamelCase), numbers, and underscores. Do not include spaces. Hyphens allowed but not preferred. Use \" \" wildcard when the FLMD applies to multiple files. For example - the same FLMD applies to all soil core files in this data package - \"soil_cores_ .csv\" File_Version - This is the version of the data file being described in the FLMD. The data file version is assigned by the data provider and not by the system. This would change if the data file is updated after the data package is published. Changes should be explained in the Notes field. Latitude Longitude Missing_Value_Codes - Report all Missing Value Codes. For columns containing numeric data, use \"-9999\" as the missing value code (or modify to match significant figures given the data). For columns containing character data, use \"N/A\" as the missing value code. If entering more than one missing value code, use a vertical bar \"|\" or semicolon \";\" instead of a comma or protect the comma with matching double quotation marks around the entire value.
