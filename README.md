# ESS-DIVE File-level Metadata Reporting Format

File-level metadata provides granular information at the data file level to enable comparison of data files within a data package and the ability to search for and locate files across the data collection. The recommended file-level metadata (FLMD) schema will describe the contents, scope, and structure of the data file within the ESS-DIVE repository.  This metadata is fully consistent with and augments the metadata collected to describe each data package.
